## Courses for which I was the instructor

In 2024-2025, I'm teaching the following courses at Concordia University:
 * Analysis in the Summer
 * Multivariate Calculus: Differential (MAST 218, MATH 264) and integral (MAST 219, MATH 265), both in the Fall and in the Winter
 * Équations différentielles ordinaires (MAST 330) in the Fall
 * Algèbre linéaire avancé (MATH 252) in the Winter
I also taught the following courses at Concordia University:
 * Advanced Calculus (differential, multivariate) (MATH 264) in the Fall 2023 and in the Winter 2024
 * Applied Advanced Calculus (differential and integral, multivariate) (ENGR 233) in the Fall 2023
 * Applied Ordinary Differential Equations (ENGR 213) in the Fall 2023
 * Advanced Linear Algebra (MATH 252) in the Winter 2024

Details about the courses are available on Moodle for enrolled students

In the past years, I taught following courses at Dartmouth College:
 * Calculus (MATH 3), in [Fall 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m3f20) and [Fall 2022](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/54901)
 * Multivariate Calculus (MATH 8), [in Fall 2019](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f19), [Winter 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8w20), and [Winter 2022](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/50321/)
 * [Probability (MATH 20)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/58340), in the Spring 2023
 * Graph Theory (MATH 38), in [Spring 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m38s20), [Spring 2021](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/46201), and [Spring 2022](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/52242/)
 * Algebraic Combinatorics (MATH 68), in [Fall 2019](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f19) and [Fall 2021](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f21)
 * [Topics in Combinatroics, Geometric Combinatorics (graduate, MATH 108)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/56422), in the Winter 2023
 * [Topics in Combinatorics, Analysis of Algorithms (graduate, MATH 118)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/44288), in the Winter 2021


I taught [General Mathematics (MAT0339)](mat0339.html) at UQAM in the Fall of 2018.


## Mentoring

At Dartmouth and at Concordia, I mentored students doing reading courses and independent research:
* Étienne Dyer worked on Conway's Angel problem when he was cosupervised by Assaf Shani and myself. Étienne was funded by the Concordia University Summer Research Award. (Summer 2024)
* Will Dowling worked on homomesy on permutations, and his work led to [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02383), to appear in _Involve_. Will was funded by the program for Undergraduate research assistantship at Dartmouth. (2022-2023)
* Roxy Holden and I worked on applying Markov Chains theory to cryptography problems such as Moving Target Defense, while she was at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physiscs Laboratory. (2022-2023)
* Peter Nielsen and Jay Chen did a reading course to learn how to use computational tools for mathematical research. (Fall 2022)
* Roxy Holden did a reading course on Markov chain and Mixing times (Spring 2021)
* Peter Morawitz [contributed](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31451) a fast algorithm to compute all increasing sequences of maximum length to SageMath. Peter was funded by the program for Undergraduate research assistantship at Dartmouth. (Winter 2021)
