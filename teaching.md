Over the academic year 2019-2020, I will teach the following courses in Dartmouth College:
 * [Algebraic Combinatorics (MATH 68)](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f19), in the fall
 * Multivariate Calculus (MATH 8), [in the fall](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f19) and [in the winter](https://math,dartmouth.edu/~m8w20)
 * Linear algebra with applications (MATH 22), in the spring

I taught [General Mathematics (MAT0339)](mat0339.html) in UQAM in the fall of 2018.
