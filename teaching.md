## Courses for which I was the instructor

This 2022-2023 academic year, I am teaching the following courses at Dartmouth College:
 * [Calculus (MATH 3)](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m3f22), in the Fall
 * [Geometric Combinatorics (graduate, MATH 108)](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m108w23), in the Winter
 * Probability (MATH 20), in the Spring

In the past years, I taught following courses at Dartmouth College:
 * [Calculus (MATH 3)](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m3f20), in the Fall 2020
 * Multivariate Calculus (MATH 8), [in Fall 2019](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f19), [Winter 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8w20), and [Winter 2022](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8w22)
 * Graph Theory (MATH 38), in [Spring 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m38s20), [Spring 2021](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m38s21), and [Spring 2022](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m38s22)
 * Algebraic Combinatorics (MATH 68), in [Fall 2019](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f19) and [Fall 2021](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f21)
 * [Topics in Combinatorics, Analysis of Algorithms (graduate, MATH 118)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/44288), in the Winter 2021


I taught [General Mathematics (MAT0339)](mat0339.html) at UQAM in the Fall of 2018.


## Mentoring

At Dartmouth, I have mentored students doing reading courses and independent research:
* Will Dowling, who is working on homomesy on permutations. Will is funded by the program for Undergraduate research assistantship at Dartmouth. (Fall 2022)
* Peter Nielsen and Jay Chen are doing a reading course to learn how to use computational tools for mathematical research. (Fall 2022)
* Roxy Holden and I are working on applying Markov Chains theory to cryptography problems such as Moving Target Defense. (2022)
* Roxy Holden, for a reading course on Markov chain and Mixing times (Spring 2021)
* Peter Morawitz, who [contributed](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31451) a fast algorithm to compute all increasing sequences of maximum length to SageMath. Peter was funded by the program for Undergraduate research assistantship at Dartmouth. (Winter 2021)
