 * Multivariate Calculus (MATH 8), [in Fall 2019](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8f19), [Winter 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m8w20), and [Winter 2022](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/50321/)
 * [Probability (MATH 20)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/58340), in the Spring 2023
 * Graph Theory (MATH 38), in [Spring 2020](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m38s20), [Spring 2021](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/46201), and [Spring 2022](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/52242/)
 * Algebraic Combinatorics (MATH 68), in [Fall 2019](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f19) and [Fall 2021](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m68f21)

I taught [General Mathematics (MAT0339)](mat0339.html) at UQAM in the Fall of 2018.


## Mentoring

At Dartmouth, I mentored students doing reading courses and independent research:
* Will Dowling is working on homomesy on permutations. Will is funded by the program for Undergraduate research assistantship at Dartmouth. (2022-2023)
* Roxy Holden and I worked on applying Markov Chains theory to cryptography problems such as Moving Target Defense, while she was at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physiscs Laboratory. (2022-2023)
* Peter Nielsen and Jay Chen did a reading course to learn how to use computational tools for mathematical research. (Fall 2022)
* Roxy Holden did a reading course on Markov chain and Mixing times (Spring 2021)
* Peter Morawitz [contributed](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/31451) a fast algorithm to compute all increasing sequences of maximum length to SageMath. Peter was funded by the program for Undergraduate research assistantship at Dartmouth. (Winter 2021)
