I'm involved in the popularization of mathematics with a diversity of audiences. For each activity that I lead, no advanced knowledge of mathematics is required.

## For everyone
I am a **mathematics guest-host** in the **radio show [_L'oeuf ou la poule_](http://www.loeufoulapoule.org)** (in French). With Stéphanie Schanck (and formerly with [Élise Vandomme](http://lacim.uqam.ca/~elise.vandomme/index_en.html)), we present every month 7 minutes about mathematical news, a puzzle or a research problem. And this takes part in a show with other passionate scientists! You can listen to [some chronicles](http://loeufoulapoule.org/category/chroniques/maths/) or [all the shows](http://www.choq.ca/emissions-details/loeuf-ou-la-poule/) online.

With Stéphanie Schanck, we also designed and gave the **[Maths in the city walking tour](http://coeurdessciences.uqam.ca/component/eventlist/details/765-maths-en-ville.html) (in French)**. These have been running for four years, while we present downtown Montreal the way mathematicians see it. This is for adults or teenagers, and since then, I designed a similar activity in Chicago and Trois-Rivières.

For the last couple editions of the 24 hours of science in Montreal, I presented with [Pauline Hubert](http://phubert.github.io), Mélodie Lapointe and Fanny Desjardins an activity for an audience of all ages to brake the secrets of the **mathematics of magic tricks**, where amazement goes along with learning about math.

## You are teacher? **Invite me in your classroom!**

**For high school students**, I give, with the support of the [Institut des Sciences mathématiques](http://ism.uqam.ca/outreach/#1492) a conference on _[How mathematics can help you finding the perfect partner](maths-de-l-amour.pdf)_! The [_Maths en ville_ walking tour](http://coeurdessciences.uqam.ca/balades-scientifiques-groupes-scolaires.html) is a perfect activity for high schoolers living in Montreal. Still talking about cities, I really like to talk about traffic, notably about the [Braess's paradox](Braesss-paradox.pdf).

**For elementary and middle school students**, I designed the mathematical play [_L'été, c'est mathématique!_](http://coeurdessciences.uqam.ca/component/eventlist/details/710-l-ete-c-est-mathematique.html) with Émile Nadeau. By myself, I also have workshops about mathematcial aspects of magic and graph theory that are ready to present.
