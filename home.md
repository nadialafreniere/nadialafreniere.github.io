I am a postdoc in combinatorics at [**Dartmouth College**](https://math.dartmouth.edu). I earned my **Ph.D. in Combinatorial Mathematics** from Université du Québec à Montréal under the advisory of [Franco Saliola](http://lacim.uqam.ca/~saliola/). Starting in the Fall, I will be an assistant professor with a limited-term appointment at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/math-stats.html).

To learn more about my  **Ph.D. and master's theses** and my research, click on the [research tab](research). To read more about my **activities to help the general public discover mathematics**, click on the [outreach tab](outreach).

Mary Versa Clemens-Sewall, a recent alumna of Dartmouth, wrote [this biography of me](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~awmcontest/2020winners/Mary_Versa_Clemens-Sewall.pdf) for the Association for Women in Mathematics' contest, and received a honor mention for it. Congratulations!
