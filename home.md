I am an assistant professor with a limited-term appointment at [**Concordia University**](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/math-stats.html). I earned my **Ph.D. in Combinatorial Mathematics** from Université du Québec à Montréal under the advisory of [Franco Saliola](https://saliola.github.io/). Before Concordia, I was a John Wesley Young research instructor at [Dartmouth College](https://math.dartmouth.edu).

Mary Versa Clemens-Sewall, a recent alumna of Dartmouth, wrote [this biography of me](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~awmcontest/2020winners/Mary_Versa_Clemens-Sewall.pdf) for the Association for Women in Mathematics' contest, and received a honor mention for it. Congratulations!
