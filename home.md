I am a postdoc in combinatorics at [**Dartmouth College**](https://math.dartmouth.edu). I earned my **Ph.D. in Combinatorial Mathematics** from Université du Québec à Montréal under the advisory of [Franco Saliola](http://lacim.uqam.ca/~saliola/).

Mary Versa Clemens-Sewall, a math major at Dartmouth, wrote [this biography of me](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~awmcontest/2020winners/Mary_Versa_Clemens-Sewall.pdf) for the Association for Women in Mathematics' contest, and received a honor mention for it. Congratulations!
